# COVID_Database

We are all aware that COVID19 pandemic is causing social distance around the world. To that end, all processes are being made available online.
The key issue is that collecting the Patients data physically is difficult. 
To address this issue, we attempted to design a web-based COVID-19 DatabaseÂ management system that collects the COVID Patient's personal data.
